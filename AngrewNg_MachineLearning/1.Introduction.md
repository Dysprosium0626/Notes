# Introduction

**Machine Learning**: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 


Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from **experience E** with respect to some **task T** and some **performance** measure **P**, if its **performance** on **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with **experience** **E**. 


监督学习：数据集存在正确答案
e.g. 房价，tumor（malignant， benign）

无监督学习：只有数据没有正确答案，聚类
e.g. 新闻分类，细分市场，垃圾邮件，DNA预测，声音处理


回归：连续
